## Solutions
For easier access to solutions, those are already compiled: just open **Solutions.pdf** in any PDF viewer (Or Google Chrome directly).

## Compiling LaTeX
This PDF file was compiled using **MiKTeX 2.9.6840 (x64)** [(download)](https://miktex.org/download "Download MiKTeX 2.9.6840 (x64)") on macOS 10.14 (Mojave) x64 architecture using this terminal command (It also requires you to install dependencies):

```
pdflatex Solutions.tex
```
MiKTeX can run on Windows, Linux/UNIX-like systems and also Docker.

There are many alternatives to compile LaTeX files, such as:
- **TeX Live** (Linux/UNIX-like systems)
- **MacTeX** (Like **TeX Live**, but for Mac OS X)
- **teTeX** (Linux/UNIX-like systems, discontinued)
- **proTeXt** (Like **MiKTeX**)
