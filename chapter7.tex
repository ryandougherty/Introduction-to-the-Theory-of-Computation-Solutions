\item[7.15]Show that P is closed under the star operation. (Hint: Use dynamic programming. On input $y = y_1\cdots y_n$ for $y_i \in \Sigma$, build a table indicating for each $i \le j$ whether the substring $y_i\cdots y_j \in A^*$ for any $A \in$ P.)
\\
\textbf{Solution:} Let $M$ be a TM that decides $A$ in polynomial time. We construct a TM $T$ to decide $A^*$ in polynomial time:
\\ \\
$T$ = ``On input $w \in \Sigma^*$:

\item[7.16]Show that NP is closed under the star operation.

\item[7.20]We generally believe that \emph{PATH} is not NP-complete. Explain the reason behind this belief. Show that proving \emph{PATH} is not NP-complete would prove P $\ne$ NP.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} We can prove the converse: if P = NP, then \emph{PATH} is NP-complete. We will do two things (in assuming P = NP): show that \emph{PATH} is NP-hard, and because \emph{PATH} $\in$ NP, \emph{PATH} is NP-complete. We will do this by showing $SAT \le_p PATH$.

\par Since P = NP, there is a decider $S$ for $SAT$ that runs in time $O(n^k)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. We construct a TM $T$ that computes the reduction:
\\ \\
$T$ = ``On input \angles{\phi} where $\phi$ is a $SAT$ formula:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]Run $S$ on input \angles{\phi}. If $S$ accepts \angles{\phi}, the construct a graph $G = (V, E)$ such that $s, t \in V, (s, t) \in E$.
\item[2.]If $S$ rejects \angles{\phi}, construct a graph $G = (V, E)$ such that $V = \{s, t\}, E = \emptyset$.
\item[3.]Output \angles{G, s, t}."
\end{enumerate}
Since this reduction takes polynomial time, then P = NP implies \emph{PATH} is NP-complete.

\item[7.22]Let $DOUBLE$-$SAT = \{$\angles{\phi} $|$ $\phi$ has at least two satisfying assignments\}. Show that $DOUBLE$-$SAT$ is NP-complete.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} We will reduce $3SAT$ to this problem. Given $\phi$ as a $3SAT$ formula, all we need to do is to introduce a new variable $x$, and create a new formula $\phi'$ as follows:
\begin{center}
$\phi' = \phi \wedge (x \vee \overline{x})$
\end{center}
We show that $\phi \in 3SAT$ if and only if $\phi' \in DOUBLE$-$SAT$. If $\phi \in 3SAT$, then there is one satisfying assignment - for $\phi'$ there are two since we can set $x = 0, 1$ and still have $\phi'$ be true. If $\phi$ is unsatisfiable, then clearly $\phi'$ is also unsatisfiable. Therefore, we are done.

\item[7.23]Let $HALF$-$CLIQUE$ = \{\angles{G} $|$ $G$ is an undirected graph having a complete subgraph with at least $\frac{m}{2}$ nodes, where $m$ is the number of nodes in $G$\}. Show that $HALF$-$CLIQUE$ is NP-complete.

\item[7.33]In the following solitaire game, you are given an $m \times m$ board. On each of its $m^2$ positions lies either a blue stone, a red stone, or nothing at all. You play by removing stones from the board until each column contains only stones of a single color and each row contains at least one stone. You win if you achieve this objective. Winning may or may not be possible, depending upon the initial configuration. Let $SOLITAIRE$ = \{\angles{G} $|$ $G$ is a winnable game configuration\}. Prove that $SOLITAIRE$ is NP-complete.

\item[7.49]Let $f: \mathcal{N} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}$ be any function where $f(n) = o(n log n)$. Show that $TIME(f(n))$ contains only the regular languages.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} We define a \textbf{\emph{crossing sequence}} (abbreviated ``C.S.") for a TM $M$ as the sequence of states that $M$ enters at a given tape cell during computation on an input. We will prove two things, which is sufficient to prove that $TIME(f(n))$ contains only the regular languages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.]A deterministic, single-tape TM with C.S.'s of bounded length decides a regular language.
\item[2.]A deterministic, single-tape TM with C.S.?s of unbounded length cannot run in $o(n log n)$ time. 
\end{enumerate}

\par For the first part, let $M$ be a deterministic, single-tape TM, and consider $M$ running on some input. If all of $M$'s C.S.'s on these inputs have length $\le k$, we can construct an NFA $N$ that simulates $M$, because $N$ only needs enough states to record the current C.S. plus a start state. $N$ then guesses the sequence of C.S.'s that would occur if $M$ processed the input string further, and also checks that adjacent C.S.'s are consistent (somewhat like a ``computation history"). Without loss of generality, assume that we modify $M$ so that it accepts at the right-most end of the input. Also, $N$'s accept states correspond to C.S.'s that contain $M$'s accept state and that match with $M$'s computation on the blank portion of the tape (initially) after the input string. Therefore, a deterministic, single-tape TM with C.S.'s of bounded length decides a regular language.

\par For the second part, we will prove by contradiction. Suppose (to the contrary) that we have a deterministic, single-tape TM $M$ that runs in $o(n log n)$ time and has C.S.'s of unbounded length. We can easily see that $M$ runs in time $bn \times log(n)$, for all $n \ge n_0$ for some constant $n_0$ (also note that all inputs are of length $n$). We can also see that for all possible inputs, at least half of the C.S.'s must have length $\le 2b \times log(n)$, as not to exceed M's running time. Define these C.S.'s as the \textbf{\emph{short crossing sequences}} (abbreviated ``S.C.S."). If $M$ has $|Q|$ states, the number of distinct C.S.'s of length $p$ is $|Q|^p$. If we choose $b$ to be small enough, it is possible to force repetition among the S.C.S.'s because $|Q|^{2b\times log(n)}$ is much less than $\frac{n}{2}$. For $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}$, consider inputs that have a C.S. of length $\ge k$ and that are of length $n_0$ or more. Let $w$ be the shortest such string, and let $i$ be the position in $w$ such that the longest C.S. occurs. We can see that 3 positions $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$ must exist that have exactly the same C.S.'s. Remove either the substring $p_1$ through $p_2-1$ or $p_2$ through $p_3-1$ from $w$ such that position $i$ is not removed. We can also see that $M$ runs on the modified string exactly the same way as it originally did on $w$, but now except for the removed portion, because positions of $w$ with exactly the same C.S.'s were overlaid. Therefore, there exists a C.S. of length $\ge k$ in this modified input. However, we originally selected $w$ to be the shortest string which has a C.S. of length $\ge k$, a contradiction. Therefore, a deterministic, single-tape TM with C.S's of unbounded length cannot run in $o(n log n)$ time.

\par This is quite strange, as all regular languages are in $TIME(n)$, and there are not any in $TIME(f(n)) \cap \overline{TIME(n)}$ where $f(n) \in o(n log n)$. However, according to (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.3648.pdf), any TM running in time $f(n) \in o(n log n)$ actually runs in linear time.
